Basically just a fully fledged out 1.0.0 for UU.
- Equal money distribution
- Revamped scaling
- (hopefully) balanced build choices
- Arcane System (which is meant to be a replacement for Ubertech)
- Powerups (and variants for those powerups)
- Weapon Modifiers instead of Special Tweaks
- [MvM Wave Generator](https://github.com/kurwabomber/mvm_generator)
- Way too many additional attributes added
- Armor/defense system revamp
- Movement oriented combat (don't stand still)
